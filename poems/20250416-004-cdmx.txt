Three chairs stand in quiet, silent grace,
Around a table carved from stone’s own tale,
Its surface smooth, a firm yet cold embrace,
No voices stir the air, no laughter’s sail.

The light through curtains soft begins to fade,
A gentle hush that fills the stillened room,
No clutter mars the calm that’s here displayed,
Just space to think, to dream without the gloom.

Each painted arch upon the table’s side,
Recalls old grandeur frozen in this frame,
Though empty now, these seats await with pride,
A gathering soon to kindle warmth and flame.

Yet in the quiet, there’s a truth so clear:
The simplest moments hold the love most dear.
