At the table where silence drapes,
Three chairs stand in gentle escape,
Metal spines with braids of light,
Echoes hold them through the night.

The air is thick with absence here,
Whispered tales we cannot hear,
A quiet room, a muted call,
Memories cling to every wall.

Stone and steel in a solemn dance,
Waiting still for a fleeting chance,
To cradle voices, stories spun,
Beneath a dim and dusted sun.

Empty seats in soft parade,
A haunting peace that time has made,
They ask, they wait, they softly plead,
For warmth to fill their hollowed need.
