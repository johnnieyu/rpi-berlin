A silent room where chairs in waiting stand,
Their backs adorned with gentle, rounded beads,
An empty table shaped by quiet hand,
Its surface smooth, bereft of urgent needs.

The light through curtains filters soft and low,
A muted world in grayscale tones confined,
Where time itself seems pausing to bestow
A breath of calm upon this still-designed.

Yet in this stillness, stories could arise,
Of laughter shared and secrets once confessed,
For though the emptiness may hypnotize,
The space invites the moments yet unvest.

So when you enter, know this roomâ€™s embrace,
Holds endless warmth within its empty space.
