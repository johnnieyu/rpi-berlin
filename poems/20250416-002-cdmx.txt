At the edge of quiet corners,  
where shadows play in silver hues,  
a table stands with stories etched  
in lines of stone and whispered grace.  

Chairs await like silent sentinels,  
their backs adorned with gentle curves,  
ready to cradle moments,  
to hold the whispers of passing time.  

The veil of light diffuses softly,  
a dance of stillness, soft and slow,  
where echoes linger in the empty space,  
and memories prepare to bloom again.  

Here, in the hush of absent voices,  
the heart finds space to breathe and dreamâ€”  
a sanctuary sculpted in calm,  
in places where the soul may rest unseen.
