Beneath the stillness in this quiet space,  
A table stands with secrets yet untold,  
Three chairs aligned, a gentle, waiting grace,  
In monochrome, their stories softly hold.  

The etched facade upon the sturdy side  
Hints at a world within each line and curve,  
Where shadows blend, and memories abide,  
A moment caught in silence, calm and verve.  

No voices stir, no laughter fills the air,  
Yet presence lingers in the empty scene,  
Inviting hearts to gather, share, and care,  
Though absent souls, the room’s embrace is keen.  

For in this hush, the promise isn’t gone—  
It waits for life, and soon will carry on.
