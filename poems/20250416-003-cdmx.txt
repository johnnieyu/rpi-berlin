A table stands with chairs drawn soft and near,  
In quiet room where silence seems to dream,  
Its edges sharp but touched by dusk's veneer,  
A moment caught within a gentle gleam.  

The chairs with backs that twist like braided lace,  
Invite the stillness of a paused embrace,  
No clutter mars this scene of simple grace,  
A hushed retreat, a calm and sacred place.  

Curtains hang like whispers, pale and sheer,  
Concealing worlds beyond the bounds of light,  
Where thoughts may float and softly disappear,  
In shadows mild that fold into the night.  

Though empty seats await a lively cheer,  
This quiet keeps its own sweet presence near.
